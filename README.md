# Physics-informed-Neural-Network-for-Option-Pricing
We apply a physics-informed deep-learning approach 1 to the Black-Scholes equation for pricing American and European options. We test our approach on both simulated as well as real market data, compare it to analytical/numeri- cal benchmarks. Our model is able to accurately capture the price behavior on simulation data, while also exhibiting reasonable performance for market data (with an improvement of 3 Ìƒ0% over benchmark). We also experiment with the architecture and learning process of our PINN model to provide more understanding of convergence and stability issues that impact performance.
